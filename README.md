# CNBlogPage
A blog page template made using HTML and CSS. 
I enrolled myself in a course for Frontend Development during the summer break of my 2nd year in B.Tech. In this course, we were given a task to make a dummy webpage with the help of HTML and CSS. This was my best try at replicating the webpage given to us and practically my first project of Web Development. All files used in this project are uploaded alongside.
I hope you find it useful, Happy Coding!
